# ZK Email Verify

**WIP: This tech is extremely tricky to use and very much a work in progress, and we do not recommend use in any production application right now. This is both due to unaudited code, and several theoretical gotchas such as lack of nullifiers, no signed bcc’s, non-nested reply signatures, upgradability of DNS, and hash sizings. None of these affect our current Twitter MVP usecase, but are not generally guaranteed. If you have a possible usecase, we are happy to help brainstorm if your trust assumptions are in fact correct!**

If you're interested in building a project with zk email or would like to contribute, [dm us](https://twitter.com/yush_g/)! Get up to date on our broad progress on the [higher level org readme](https://github.com/zkemail). While this circom code is complete, it is quite slow client side (see benchmarks below), and we are working quite hard to put up a secure, ultrafast version with halo2 by Q2 2023. We are also hoping to release a broader SDK so it will be very easy to put up new zk email applications.

## MVP App

The application is located at https://zkemail.xyz. It only works on Chrome/Brave/Arc (or other Chromium-based browsers) due to download limits on other browsers. To understand the construction more, read [our blog post here](https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/zkemail).

The documentation for the app is located at https://zkemail.xyz/docs (WIP). Made by [@yush_g](https://twitter.com/yush_g) and [@sampriti0](https://twitter.com/sampriti0) at [@0xparc](https://twitter.com/0xparc), dm if interested in usage or building next generation primitives like this. This is very much a work in progress, and we invite folks to contribute, or contact us for interesting projects that can be built on top of the tech! We are especially prioritizing optimizing circuits, making our end-to-end demo more efficient and on-chain, and an SDK/CLI.

### Local website

To run the frontend with existing circuits (there is no backend or server), enable Node 16 (with nvm) and run:

```
yarn start
```

If the frontend shows an error on fullProve line, run this and rerun

```
yarn add snarkjs@https://github.com/sampritipanda/snarkjs.git#fef81fc51d17a734637555c6edbd585ecda02d9e
```

### Getting email headers

In Outlook, turn on plain text mode. Copy paste the 'full email details' into the textbox on the (only client side!) webpage.

In gmail, download original message then copy paste the contents into the textbox.

## Development Instructions

This will let you build new zkeys from source.

### Regex to Circom

First, generate a regex. Go to our [min_dfa fork](https://mindfa.onrender.com/min_dfa) of cyberzhg's toolbox and insert your regex on the top line. We've forked [min-dfa into a UI here](https://mindfa.onrender.com/min_dfa) to create a UI that converts existing regexes with [] support, as well as escapes \_, and the character classes a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. It also shows the DFA states very clearly so you can choose accept states easily. This should make converting regexes into DFA form way cleaner.

Modify either `let raw_regex = ` (that supports actual regex strings like `[A-Za-z0-9]` [but no other character ranges]) or modify `let regex = ` (that does not support brackets or character ranges and supports only the limited syntax in https://cyberzhg.github.io/toolbox/min_dfa) in regex_to_circom/regex_to_dfa.js and then run `python3 gen.py`.

### Email Circuit Build Steps

Install rust/circom2 via the following steps, according to: https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh # Install rust if don't already have
source "$HOME/.cargo/env" # Also rust installation step

git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev libgmp-dev nasm # Ubuntu packages needed for C-based witness generator
sudo apt install build-essential # Ubuntu
brew install nlohmann-json gmp nasm # OSX
cd circom
cargo build --release
cargo install --path circom
```

Inside `zk-email-verify` folder, do

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash # If don't have npm
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh # If don't have npm
nvm install 16 # If don't have node 16
nvm use 16 # If not using node 16
sudo npm i -g yarn # If don't have yarn (may need to remove sudo)
yarn install # If this fails, delete yarn.lock and try again
```

To get the ptau, do (note that you only need the 22 file right now)

```bash
wget https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau
mv powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau circuits/powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau

wget https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_21.ptau
# shasum pot21_final.ptau: e0ef07ede5c01b1f7ddabb14b60c0b740b357f70
mv powersOfTau28_hez_final_21.ptau circuits/powersOfTau28_hez_final_21.ptau
```

<!-- Previously snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#fae4fe381bdad2da13eee71010dfe477fc694ac1 -->
<!-- Now -> yarn add https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs/commits/chunk_zkey_gen -->

Put the email into ...\*.eml. Edit the constant filename at the top of generate_input.ts to import that file, then use the output of running that file as the input file (you may need to rename it). You'll need this for both zkey and verifier generation.

To create a chunked zkey for in-browser proving, run the following on a high CPU computer:

```bash
yarn add snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#24981febe8826b6ab76ae4d76cf7f9142919d2b8 # Swap to chunked generation version for browser, leave this line out for serverside proofs onluy
cd dizkus-scripts/
cp entropy.env.example entropy.env
```

Not put random characters into the values for entropy1 and entropy2, and hexadecimal characters into the beacon. These scripts will compile and test your zkey for you.

```
./1_compile.sh && ./2_gen_wtns.sh && ./3_gen_chunk_zkey.sh && ./4_gen_vkey.sh && ./5_gen_proof.sh
```

If you want to run a fast server side prover, install rapidsnark and test proofgen:

```
cd ../../
git clone https://github.com/iden3/rapidsnark
cd rapidsnark
npm install
git submodule init
git submodule update
npx task createFieldSources
```

You're supposed to run `npx task buildPistache` next, but that errored, so I had to manually build the pistache lib first:

```
cd depends/pistache
sudo apt-get install meson ninja-build
meson setup build --buildtype=release
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
sudo ldconfig
cd ../..
```

Then, from rapidsnark/ I could run

```
npx task buildProverServer
```

And from zk-email-verify, convert your proof params to a rapidsnark friendly version:

```

cd ../zk-email-verify/dizkus-scripts
./6_gen_proof_rapidsnark.sh

```

To upload zkeys to an s3 box on AWS, change bucket_name in upload_to_s3.py and run:

```
sudo apt install awscli # Ubuntu
brew install awscli # Mac

aws configure # Only needs to be run once
pip3 install boto3
python3 upload_to_s3.py
yarn add snarkjs@https://github.com/sampritipanda/snarkjs.git#fef81fc51d17a734637555c6edbd585ecda02d9e # Revert to frontend version
```

If you want to upload different files, you can parameterize the script as well:

```
python3 dizkus-scripts/upload_to_s3.py --dirs ~/zk-email-verify/build/email/email_js/ --bucket_name zkemail-zkey-chunks --prefix email.wasm
```

Note that there's no .zkeya file, only .zkeyb ... .zkeyk. The script will automatically zip into .tar.gz files and load into s3 bucket.

We use a fork of [zkp.ts](https://github.com/personaelabs/heyanon/blob/main/lib/zkp.ts) to load these keys into localforage. In the browser, to read off of localforage, you have to use this fork when running the frontend locally/in prod:

```

yarn install snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#53e86631b5e409e5bd30300611b495ca469503bc

```

Manually copy paste the modulus in the resulting generated file into solidity verified mailserver keys.

Change s3 address in the frontend to your bucket.

To do a non-chunked zkey for non-browser running,

```

yarn compile-all

```

### Really Large Circuits

If your circuit ends up being > 20M constraints, you will need to follow [these guidelines](https://hackmd.io/V-7Aal05Tiy-ozmzTGBYPA?view#Compilation-and-proving) to compile it.

### Compiling Subcircuits

If you want to compile subcircuits instead of the whole thing, you can use the following:

If you want to generate a new email/set of inputs, edit the src/constants.ts file with your constants.
In generate_input.ts, change the circuitType variable inside to match what circom file you are running, then run

```bash
npm install typescript ts-node -g
# uncomment do_generate function call at end of file
# go to tsconfig.json and change esnext to CommonJS
# if weird things dont work with this and yarn start, go go node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.ts and add/cut `target: 'node',` after like 793 after `node:`.
npx tsc --moduleResolution node --target esnext src/scripts/generate_input.ts
```

which will autowrite input\_<circuitName>.json to the inputs folder.

To do the steps in https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs#7-prepare-phase-2 automatically, do

```
yarn compile email true
```

and you can swap `email` for `sha` or `rsa` or any other circuit name that matches your generate_input type.

and when the circuit doesn't change,

```
yarn compile email true skip-r1cswasm
```

and when the zkey also doesn't change,

```
yarn compile email true skip-r1cswasm skip-zkey
```

### Production

For production, make sure to set a beacon in .env.

Note that this leaks the number of characters in the username of someone who sent you an email, iff the first field in the email serialization format is from (effectively irrelevant).

### Testing

To constraint count, do

```
cd circuits
node --max-old-space-size=614400 ./../node_modules/.bin/snarkjs r1cs info email.r1cs
```

To test solidity,

```
cp node_modules/forge-std src/contracts/lib/forge-std
cd src/contracts
forge test
```

To deploy contract to forked mainnet, do:

```
anvil --fork-url https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/***REMOVED*** --port 8547 # Run in tmux
export ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547

# Public anvil sk
export SK=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
forge create --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL StringUtils --private-key $SK --via-ir --force
forge create --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL NFTSVG --private-key $SK --via-ir --force

# Edit the Cargo.toml to have the two deployment addresses, then call this
forge create --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL VerifiedTwitterEmail --private-key $SK --via-ir --force
```

For just the contracts, can do

```
forge create --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL src/contracts/src/emailVerifier.sol:Verifier --private-key $SK
```

### Optimization plan

The current circom version is too expensive for any widely deployed in-browser use case, even with a plethora of tricks (chunked zkeys, single threaded proof gen for lower memory, compressing zkey and decompressing locally, etc.).

Short term ways to improve the performance would be to replace the regex checks with substring checks for everything except the email header, where we need regex (as far as we can tell) to correctly parse the "from" or "to" email from the header.

Looking more long term, we are actively using Halo2 and Nova to speed up the most expensive operations of regex and SHA. As hash functions and regex DFA traversal are repeated operations, they are a great fit for Nova's folding methods to compress repeated computation into a constant sized folded instance. But to actually use Nova to fold expensive operations outside of Halo2/Groth16, we need to verify the folded instance is valid inside the circuit for zero-knowledge and to link it to the rest of the computation. We also are attempting to use the lookup feature of Halo2 to precompute the entire table of possible regex state transitions, and just looking up that all of the transitions made are valid ones in the table instead of expensively checking each state! This idea is due to Sora Suegami, explained in more detail here: https://hackmd.io/@SoraSuegami/Hy9dWgT8i.

The current set of remaining tasks and potential final states is documented in the following DAG, please reach out if any of the projects seem interesting!

![Optimization plan](public/zk_email_optim.jpg)

### General guidelines

Just RSA + SHA (without masking or regex proofs) for arbitrary message length <= 512 bytes is 402,802 constraints, and the zkey took 42 minutes to generate on an intel mac.

RSA + SHA + Regex + Masking with up to 1024 byte message lengths is 1,392,219 constraints, and the chunked zkey took 9 + 15 + 15 + 2 minutes to generate on a machine with 32 cores.

The full email header circuit above with the 7-byte packing into signals is 1,408,571 constraints, with 163 public signals, and the verifier script fits in the 24kb contract limit.

The full email header and body check circuit, with 7-byte packing and final public output compression, is **3,115,057 constraints**, with 21 public signals. zkey size was originally 1.75GB, and with tar.gz compression it is now 982 MB.

In the browser, on a 2019 Intel Mac on Chrome, proving uses 7.3/8 cores. zk-gen takes 384 s, groth16 prove takes 375 s, and witness calculation takes 9 s.

For baremetal, proof generation time on 16 CPUs took 97 seconds. Generating zkey 0 took 17 minutes. zkey 1 and zkey 2 each took 5 minutes. r1cs + wasm generation took 5 minutes. Witness generation took 16 seconds. cpp generation of witness gen file (from script 6) took 210 minutes -- we do not run this pathway anymore.

### Scrubbing Sensitive Files

```
brew install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --replace-text <(echo "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000abcdef")
git filter-repo --path mit_msg.eml --invert-paths
git remote add origin https://github.com/zk-email-verify/zk-email-verify
ls
git push --set-upstream origin main --force
```

## Regexes we compiled

Test these on cyberzhg's toolbox modified at [zkregex.com/min_dfa](https://zkregex.com/min_dfa). The regex to get out the from/to emails is:

```
// '(\r\n|\x80)(to|from):([A-Za-z0-9 _."@-]+<)?[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+>?\r\n';
// let regex = '(\r\n|\x80)(to|from):((a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9| |_|.|"|@|-)+<)?(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|_|.|-)+@(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|_|.|-)+>?\r\n';
```

The regex to get out the body hash is:

```
const key_chars = '(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z)';
const catch_all = '(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|!|"|#|$|%|&|\'|\\(|\\)|\\*|\\+|,|-|.|/|:|;|<|=|>|\\?|@|[|\\\\|]|^|_|`|{|\\||}|~| |\t|\n|\r|\x0b|\x0c)';
const catch_all_without_semicolon = '(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|!|"|#|$|%|&|\'|\\(|\\)|\\*|\\+|,|-|.|/|:|<|=|>|\\?|@|[|\\\\|]|^|_|`|{|\\||}|~| |\t|\n|\r|\x0b|\x0c)';
const base_64 = '(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|\\+|/|=)';

let regex = `\r\ndkim-signature:(${key_chars}=${catch_all_without_semicolon}+; )+bh=${base_64}+; `;
```

The regex for Twitter is:

```
const word_char = '(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|_)';
let regex = `email was meant for @${word_char}+`;
```

## FAQ/Possible Errors

### I'm having issues with the intricacies of the SHA hashing. How do I understand the function better?

Use https://sha256algorithm.com/ as an explainer! It's a great visualization of what is going on, and our code should match what is going on there.

### What are the differences between generating proofs (snarkjs.groth16.fullprove) on the client vs. on a server?

If the server is generating the proof, it has to have the private input. We want people to own their own data, so client side proving is the most secure both privacy and anonymity wise. There are fancier solutions (MPC, FHE, recursive proofs etc), but those are still in the research stage.

### “Cannot resolve module ‘fs’”

Fixed by downgrading react-scripts version.

### TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')

This is the full error:

```
zk-email-verify/src/scripts/generateinput.ts:182
const = result.results[0].publicKey.toString();
                                    ^
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')
```

You need to have internet connection while running dkim verification locally, in order to fetch the public key. If you have internet connection, make sure you downloaded the email with the headers: you should see a DKIM section in the file.

### No available storage method found.

If when using snarkjs, you see this:

```
[ERROR] snarkJS: Error: No available storage method found. [full path]
/node_modules/localforage/dist/localforage.js:2762:25
```

Rerun with this:
`yarn add snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#24981febe8826b6ab76ae4d76cf7f9142919d2b8`

### I'm trying to edit the circuits, and running into the error 'Non-quadratic constraints are not allowed!'

The line number of this error is usually arbitrary. Make sure you are not mixing signals and variables anywhere: signals can only be assigned once, and assigned to other signals (not variables), and cannot be used as parameters in control flow like for, if, array indexing, etc. You can get versions of these by using components like isEqual, lessThan, and quinSelector, respectively.

### Where do I get the public key for the signature?

Usually, this will be hosted on DNS server of some consistent URL under the parent organization. You can try to get it from a .pem file, but that is usually a fraught effort since the encoding of such files varies a lot, is idiosyncratic, and hard to parse. The easiest way is to just extract it from the RSA signature itself (like our generate_input.ts file), and just verify that it matches the parent organization.

### How can I trust that you verify the correct public key?

You can see the decomposed public key in our Solidity verifier, and you can auto-check this against the mailserver URL. This prevents the code from falling victim to DNS spoofing attacks. We don't have mailserver key rotations figured out right now, but we expect that can be done trustlessly via DNSSEC (though not widely enabled) or via deploying another contract.

### How do I get a Verifier.sol file that matches my chunked zkeys?

You should be able to put in identical randomness on both the chunked zkey fork and the regular zkey generation fork in the beacon and Powers of Tau phase 2, to be able to get the same zkey in both a chunked and non-chunked form. You can then run compile.js, or if you prefer the individual line, just `node --max-old-space-size=614400 ${snarkJSPath} zkey export solidityverifier ${cwd}/circuits/${circuitNamePrimary}/keys/circuit_final.zkey ${cwd}/circuits/contracts/verifier.sol`, where you edit the path variables to be your preferred ones.

The chunked file utils will automatically search for circuit_final.zkeyb from this command line call if you are using the chunked zkey fork (you'll know you have that fork, if you have a file called chunkFileUtils in snarkJS).

### How do I deal with all of these snarkJS forks?

Apologies, this part is some messy legacy code from previous projects. You use vivekab's fork for keygeneration, sampritipanda's fork for chunked zkey checking on the frontend, and the original snarkjs@latest to get rid of chunking entirely (but you'll need to edit frontend code to not do that). You can do something like `./node_modules/bin/snarkjs' inside your repo, and it'll run the snarkjs command built from the fork you're using instead of the global one.

### How do I build my own frontend but plug in your ZK parsing?

zkp.ts is the key file that calls the important proving functions. You should be able to just call the exported functions from there, along with setting up your own s3 bucket and setting the constants at the top.

### Why did you choose GPL over MIT licensing?

Since circom is GPL, we are forced to use the GPL license, which is still a highly permissive license. You can dm us if you'd like to treat non-circom parts of the repo as MIT licensed, but broadly we are pro permissive open source usage with attribution! We hope that those who derive profit from this primitive contribute that money altruistically back to this technology.

## To-Do

- Make a general method to get formatted signatures and bodies from all email clients
- Make versions for different size RSA keys
- Add ENS DNSSEC code (possibly SNARKed), so anyone can add a website's RSA key via DNS record
- Design the NFT/POAP to have the user's domain/verified identity on it and display SVG properly on opensea
- Make a testnet faucet as a PoC for Sybil resistance and to get developers interested
- Dynamically tradeoff between gzip (2x faster decompression) and xz (30% smaller file size): https://www.rootusers.com/gzip-vs-bzip2-vs-xz-performance-comparison/ based on internet speed (i.e. minimize download time + unzip time)
- Fix these circom bugs from `circom email.circom --inspect`:
