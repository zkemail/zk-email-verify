**WIP: This tech is extremely tricky to use and very much a work in progress, and we do not recommend use in any production application right now. This is both due to unaudited code, and several theoretical issues such as nullifiers, bcc’s, non-nested signatures, and hash sizings. We are working on addressing those, and if you have a possible usecase, please run it by us so we can ensure that your guarantees are in fact correct!**

# MVP App

The application is located at https://zkemail.xyz. It only works on Chrome/Brave/Arc (or other Chromium-based browsers) due to download limits on other browsers.

The documentation for the app is located at https://zkemail.xyz/docs (WIP). Made by [@yush_g](https://twitter.com/yush_g) and [@sampriti0](https://twitter.com/sampriti0) at [@0xparc](https://twitter.com/0xparc) and [@personae_labs](https://twitter.com/personae_labs), dm if interested in usage or building next generation primitives like this. This is very much a work in progress, and we invite folks to contribute, or contact us for interesting projects that can be built on top of the tech! We are especially prioritizing optimizing circuits, making our end-to-end demo more efficient and on-chain, and an SDK/CLI.

## Local website

To run the frontend with existing circuits (there is no backend or server), enable Node 16 (with nvm) and run:

```
yarn start
```

## Getting email headers

In Outlook, turn on plain text mode. Copy paste the 'full email details' into the textbox on the (only client side!) webpage.

In gmail, download original message then copy paste the contents into the textbox.

This will let you build new zkeys from source.

## Regex to Circom

Modify the `let regex = ` in lexical.js and then run `python3 gen.py`

## Email Circuit Build Steps

Install rust/circom2 via the following steps, according to: https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh # Install rust if don't already have
source "$HOME/.cargo/env" # Also rust installation step

git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
cd circom
cargo build --release
cargo install --path circom
sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev libgmp-dev nasm # Ubuntu packages needed for C-based witness generator
brew install nlohmann-json gmp nasm # OSX
```

Inside `zk-email-verify` folder, do

```
sudo npm i -g yarn # If don't have yarn
yarn install # If this fails, delete yarn.lock and try again
```

To get the ptau, do (note that you only need the 22 file right now)

```bash
wget https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau
mv powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau powersoftau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau

wget https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_21.ptau
# shasum pot21_final.ptau: e0ef07ede5c01b1f7ddabb14b60c0b740b357f70
mv powersOfTau28_hez_final_21.ptau powersoftau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_21.ptau
```

To create a chunked zkey for in-browser proving, run the following (likely on a high CPU computer):

<!-- Previously snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#fae4fe381bdad2da13eee71010dfe477fc694ac1 -->
<!-- Now -> yarn add https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs/commits/chunk_zkey_gen -->

```bash
yarn add snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#24981febe8826b6ab76ae4d76cf7f9142919d2b8
cd dizkus-scripts/
./1_compile.sh && ./2_gen_wtns.sh && ./3_gen_chunk_zkey.sh && ./4_gen_vkey.sh && ./5_gen_proof.sh
# optional: ./6_gen_proof_rapidsnark.sh
aws configure # Only needs to be run once
pip3 install boto3
python3 upload_to_s3.py
```

Note that there's no .zkeya file, only .zkeyb ... .zkeyk. The script will automatically zip into .tar.gz files and load into s3 bucket.

We use a fork of [zkp.ts](https://github.com/personaelabs/heyanon/blob/main/lib/zkp.ts) to load these keys into localforage. In the browser, to read off of localforage, you have to use this fork when running the frontend locally/in prod:

```
yarn install snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#53e86631b5e409e5bd30300611b495ca469503bc
```

Change s3 address to your bucket.

Put the email into ...\*eml. Edit generate_input.json to import it. Manually copy paste the modulus in the resulting generated file into solidity verified mailserver keys.

To do a non-chunked zkey for non-browser running,

```
yarn compile-all
```

## Compiling Subcircuits

If you want to compile subcircuits instead of the whole thing, you can use the following:

If you want to generate a new email/set of inputs, edit the src/constants.ts file with your constants.
In generate_input.ts, change the circuitType variable inside to match what circom file you are running, then run

```bash
npm install typescript ts-node -g
# uncomment do_generate function call at end of file
# go to tsconfig.json and change esnext to CommonJS
# if weird things dont work with this and yarn start, go go node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.ts and add/cut `target: 'node',` after like 793 after `node:`.
npx tsc --moduleResolution node --target esnext circuits/scripts/generate_input.ts
```

which will autowrite input\_<circuitName>.json to the inputs folder.

To do the steps in https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs#7-prepare-phase-2 automatically, do

```
yarn compile email true
```

and you can swap `email` for `sha` or `rsa` or any other circuit name that matches your generate_input type.

and when the circuit doesn't change,

```
yarn compile email true skip-r1cswasm
```

and when the zkey also doesn't change,

```
yarn compile email true skip-r1cswasm skip-zkey
```

## Production

For production, make sure to set a beacon in .env.

Note that this leaks the number of characters in the username of someone who sent you an email, iff the first field in the email serialization format is from (effectively irrelevant).

## Testing

To constraint count, do

```
cd circuits
node --max-old-space-size=614400 ./../node_modules/.bin/snarkjs r1cs info email.r1cs
```

To test solidity,

```
cp node_modules/forge-std src/contracts/lib/forge-std
cd src/contracts
forge test
```

To deploy contract to forked mainnet, do:

```
anvil --fork-url https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/***REMOVED*** --port 8547 # Run in tmux
export ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547
forge create --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL src/contracts/src/emailVerifier.sol:Verifier --private-key  0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 # Public anvil sk
```

## Stats

Just RSA + SHA (without masking or regex proofs) for arbitrary message length <= 512 bytes is 402802 constraints, and the zkey took 42 minutes to generate on an intel mac.

RSA + SHA + Regex + Masking with up to 1024 byte message lengths is 1,392,219 constraints, and the chunked zkey took 9 + 15 + 15 + 2 minutes to generate on a machine with 32 cores.

The full email header circuit above with the 7-byte packing into signals is 1,408,571 constraints, with 163 public signals, and the verifier script fits in the 24kb contract limit.

The full email header and body check circuit, with 7-byte packing and final public output compression, is **3,115,057 constraints**, with 21 public signals. zkey size was originally 1.75GB, and with tar.gz compression it is now 982 MB. Decompression doesn't work in the browser however.

In the browser, on a 2019 Intel Mac on Chrome, proving uses 7.3/8 cores. zk-gen takes 384 s, groth16 prove takes 375 s, and witness calculation takes 9 s.

For baremetal, proof generation time on 16 CPUs took 97 seconds. Generating zkey 0 took 17 minutes. Unclear about zkey 1. Zkey 2 took 5 minutes. r1cs + wasm generation took 5 minutes. Witness generation took 16 seconds. cpp witness gen file generation (from script 6) took 210 minutes.

### Scrubbing Sensitive Files

```
brew install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --replace-text <(echo "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000abcdef")
git filter-repo --path mit_msg.eml --invert-paths
git remote add origin https://github.com/zk-email-verify/zk-email-verify
ls
git push --set-upstream origin main --force
```

## Possible Errors

### No available storage method found.

If when using snarkjs, you see this:

```
[ERROR] snarkJS: Error: No available storage method found. [full path]
/node_modules/localforage/dist/localforage.js:2762:25
```

Rerun with this:
`yarn add snarkjs@git+https://github.com/vb7401/snarkjs.git#24981febe8826b6ab76ae4d76cf7f9142919d2b8`

## To-Do

- Make the frontend Solidity calls work
- Make a general method to get formatted signatures and bodies from all email clients
- Make versions for different size RSA keys
- Add ENS DNSSEC code (possibly SNARKed), so anyone can add a website's RSA key via DNS record
- Design the NFT/POAP to have the user's domain/verified identity on it
- Make a testnet faucet as a PoC for Sybil resistance and to get developers interested
