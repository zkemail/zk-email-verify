# Usage Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to use the ZK Email Verifier. It covers the process from converting your email to regex to creating your zero-knowledge proof for email verification. The guide assumes you have already installed the necessary packages as outlined in the [Installation Guide](../Installation/README.md). If you haven't done so, please refer to the Installation Guide first.


For an easy setup, we suggest utilizing [Zkrepl](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex), a playground for compiling and testing your circuits in the early stages of development. Additionally, explore our [Proof of Twitter guide](https://prove.email/blog/twitter) for a practical demonstration on how to leverage our SDKs to construct your own circuits.

## Step 1: Create the Regex File
Transform your target email string into a regex format and compile it into a regex.circom file. For guidance, visit our [zk-regex repository](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex).

Use our tool to convert regex into circom code here: [zkregex.com](https://zkregex.com/)


## Step 2: Implementing the Circuits
Next, use `email-verifier.circom` from the zk-email/circuits package to create your zk circuit to verify the DKIM signature.


To set up your own circuit for the email-verifier, you can follow these steps:

1. Include the `email-verifier.circom` file from the `@zk-email/circuits` package as well as the `regex.circom` file that was generated from Step 1 of this guide.
2. Create a template for your circuit, let's call it `MyCircuit`.
3. Define the input signal for your circuit, which will come from your `input.ts` file.
4. Add any necessary witnesses and constraints for regex (learn more about how to setup regex [here]( https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex))
5. Define the output signal, which will be public.
6. Instantiate the `EmailVerifier` component within your `MyCircuit` template.

NOTE: For teams using the email verifier circuit with the `ignoreBodyHashCheck` option disabled, please be aware of an important consideration. If you are conducting a body hash check within your own circuit configurations, it is essential to implement AssertZeroes for all characters beyond the specified limit.
```
AssertZeroPadding(maxBodyLength)(emailBody, emailBodyLength + 1);
```
- maxBodyLength: maximum number of bytes that the email body can occupy.
- emailBody: email body content that has been padded to meet the required size for processing.
- emailBodyLength: length of the email body including the padding.

Here's an example of how you can set up your own circuit:

```javascript
include "@zk-email/circuits/email-verifier.circom";
include "simple_regex.circom"

template MyCircuit() {
    signal input // inputs from your input.ts file

    // Witnesses and constraints for regex go here

    signal output // output that is public

    component emailVerifier {
 // public inputs are specified here
         } = MyCircuit();
}
```

## Step 3: Compile your circuit

To compile the circuit locally, you need to have Rust and Circom installed first. You can visit this link to install both https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-dependencies


```bash
circom -l node_modules MyCircuit.circom -o --r1cs --wasm --sym --c --O0
```
*Note: You can add `-l` to specify the directory where the directive `include` should look for the circuits indicated. For our repo, if you are having errors, we recommend to use `circom -l node_modules` instead of `circom`.*

We generally recommend using the --O0 flag for ensuring there are no unintended underconstraints, but if you need to optimize constraints and understand what is being changed in circom, feel free to use --O1 instead. It's important to avoid using the `--O2` flag as that is the default setting and it may lead to the deletion of addition constraints.

Refer to these discussions on StackOverflow ([1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78136647/circom-does-not-create-a-constraint-for-addition/78177349#78177349), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77688466/circom-compiler-removes-crucial-constraint-after-simplication/78177354?noredirect=1#comment137833229_78177354)) for more information on constraint deletion.

After running this command, the circuit will be compiled into a `.r1cs` file, a `.wasm` file, and a `.sym` file. These files are used in the next steps to generate the proving and verifying keys, and to compute the witness.

## Step 4: Generate Circuit Inputs

The second step in the zkEmail verification process is to generate the necessary circuit inputs. This involves parsing the email headers to extract the required information. 

The required information includes the RSA signature, the public key, the body of the email, and the hash of the email body. To do this, create a directory named 'emls' and place the raw email inside it.

Next, create an `inputs.ts` file. In this file, you will use the `generateEmailVerifierInputs` function from the `@zk-email/helpers` to specify all of your inputs and ensure they match the DKIM in your email header. 

Here is a sample code snippet from our [proof-of-twitter](https://github.com/zkemail/proof-of-twitter/blob/main/packages/circuits/helpers/generate-inputs.ts) example to guide you:

```typescript
import { bytesToBigInt, fromHex } from "@zk-email/helpers/dist/binaryFormat";
import { generateEmailVerifierInputs } from "@zk-email/helpers/dist/input-generators";

export const STRING_PRESELECTOR = "email was meant for @";
export type IExampleCircuitInputs = {
  twitterUsernameIndex: string;
  address: string;
  emailHeader: string[];
  emailHeaderLength: string;
  pubkey: string[];
  signature: string[];
  emailBody?: string[] | undefined;
  emailBodyLength?: string | undefined;
  precomputedSHA?: string[] | undefined;
  bodyHashIndex?: string | undefined;
};

export async function generateExampleVerifierCircuitInputs(
  email: string | Buffer,
  ethereumAddress: string
): Promise<ITwitterCircuitInputs> {
  const emailVerifierInputs = await generateEmailVerifierInputs(email, {
    shaPrecomputeSelector: STRING_PRESELECTOR,
  });

  const bodyRemaining = emailVerifierInputs.emailBody!.map((c) => Number(c)); // Char array to Uint8Array
  const selectorBuffer = Buffer.from(STRING_PRESELECTOR);
  const usernameIndex =
    Buffer.from(bodyRemaining).indexOf(selectorBuffer) + selectorBuffer.length;

  const address = bytesToBigInt(fromHex(ethereumAddress)).toString();

  return {
    ...emailVerifierInputs,
    twitterUsernameIndex: usernameIndex.toString(),
    address,
  };
}
```

To generate the `input.json` file, run the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node inputs.ts
```

Note: Increasing the `emailHeaderLength` or `emailBodyLength` sizes will increase the time required for compiling and creating proving keys.




## Step 5: Compute the Witness

The process of creating a proof involves ensuring that all signals in the file adhere to the existing constraints. This is achieved by computing the witness using the Wasm file generated during compilation. 

Navigate to the MyCircuit_js file and incorporate the input.json file that was produced in Step 2. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```
node generate_witness.js myCircuit.wasm input.json witness.wtns

```

This operation will produce a file named 'witness.wtns'. This file is encoded in a format that is compatible with the snarkjs library. In the following steps, we will utilize snarkJs to initiate the proof creation process.

## Step 6: Proving the Circuit

The next step involves using the `snarkjs` command-line tool to generate the keys and the verifier contract. If you haven't installed `snarkjs` globally, you can do so by running `npm install -g snarkjs`.

The generation of the zk proof requires a trusted setup, which includes the `powers of tau ceremony` and `phase 2`. Click [here](https://ceremony.pse.dev/projects/ZKP2P%20Trusted%20Setup%20Ceremony) to read more about Trusted Setup.

Firstly, you need to determine the constraint size of your circuit. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
snarkjs r1cs info myCircuit.r1cs
```
### Memory Allocation for snarkjs
To avoid out-of-memory errors in `snarkjs` for large circuits, increase Node.js memory with `node --max-old-space-size=<size>`, where `<size>` is in kilobytes.
```
node --max-old-space-size=614400 ./../node_modules/.bin/snarkjs
```


### Powers of Tau

Based on the amount of constraints you have, there are different ptau files that you are able to download. You can download the ptau file directly from Google Cloud Platform using the following command:

```
// For projects with up to 2 million constraints:
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/zkevm/ptau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_21.ptau

// For projects with up to 4 million constraints:
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/zkevm/ptau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau 

// For projects with up to 8 million constraints:
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/zkevm/ptau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_23.ptau

Refer to this link for more details: https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs?tab=readme-ov-file#7-prepare-phase-2
```
### Phase 2

For Phase 2 of the trusted setup you can either use https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/To run Phase 2 of the trusted setup refer to this link: https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs

## Step 7: Verify your circuit

After this process you should get three files
-  the proving key(vkey)
- proof.json
- public.json

You can use these files to verify your circuit.

### Off-chain Verification
To verify your proof run:

```bash
snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json

```

The command uses the files verification_key.json we exported earlier,proof.json and public.json to check if the proof is valid. If the proof is valid, the command outputs an OK.


### On-chain Verification
To create a solidity verifier that allows you to verify your proof on the ethereum blockchain, run:

```bash
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier muyCircuit_0001.zkey verifier.sol

```

This will generate a `verifier.sol` contract.
